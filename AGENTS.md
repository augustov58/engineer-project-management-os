# Engineer Project Management OS

Internal operations dashboard for engineering projects (schedule, budget, tasks, RFIs, submittals, documents, risks) with a Pi-powered copilot.

## Read this first

Before any work, read [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md). It points to the authoritative plan.

## Source of truth

The Obsidian vault is the single source of truth for this project's documentation, decisions, and progress:

```
/home/augusto/Obsidian Notes/Projects/Engineer Project Management OS/
```

- `PRD and Architecture.md` - product requirements, architecture, milestones, backlog.
- `docs/adr/` - architecture decision records 0001-0019; check each `Status:` line, several are superseded.
- `docs/glossary.md` - domain glossary.

Never let the vault docs drift from reality. Update them as work happens (see CONTEXT.md for the update rules).

## Current status

Slice 1 — the walking skeleton and the test harness (issue #2) — is built. The plan is the
six-step **Revised MVP sequence** in `PRD and Architecture.md`, and the MVP is ticketed as
GitHub issues #2-#22. Step 1, entering T-1's open items against the real project, is next.
Work one ticket at a time, and only when asked.

`pnpm dev` starts everything; `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` each run from the repo root.
See [README.md](./README.md).

## Ground rules for agents

- Plan changes, scope adjustments, and vendor decisions get recorded in the vault, not only in code or commits.
- Milestone completion updates the vault progress section in the same session.
- Follow the ADRs; if an ADR must change, write a new/superseding ADR in the vault first.
- Stack: TypeScript monorepo (pnpm), Next.js frontend, Fastify API (ADR-0021), PostgreSQL + Prisma, Redis + BullMQ, S3 docs, Pi SDK via `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`.
- Never call `new Date()` or `Date.now()` for a timestamp that gets persisted or aged, and never give such a column a database default — read the injected `TimeSource` (ADR-0022). Aging is tested by advancing a fake, never by sleeping.
- Tests drive the HTTP API against a real PostgreSQL and assert only on responses and subsequent reads. Build fixtures through the API, not by inserting rows.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues via the `gh` CLI, account `augustov58`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context, but the glossary and ADRs live in the Obsidian vault, not under `docs/adr/` here. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
